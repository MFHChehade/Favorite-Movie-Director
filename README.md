# Favorite-Movie-Director
This work aims to find the favorite movie director for an IMDb user based on his/her ratings. 

An IMDb user can export his/her ratings into a .csv file. This file can be used by the developed code to find the following:
- The list of directors sorted based on average rating for his/her movies
- The list of directors sorted based on the number of his/her movies watched 
- The list of directors sorted based on average rating for his/her top "x" movies
